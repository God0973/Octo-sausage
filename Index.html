<h1>The Heart</h1>

<a href="https://rroll.to/QdLunS">
  <div class="big" >
    <p>The heart is a hollow muscle, about the size of a fist, that pumps blood all throughout the human body. The heart delivers oxygen and nutrients to the cells, while removing metabolic waste. It is one of the most important organs in the human body. The heart can survive for 4 to 6 hours outside the human body on ice, before it stops beating, and is no longer viable.</p>

<p class=right>
The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the tissue, while carrying metabolic waste -such as carbon dioxide- to the lungs.
</p>

<p>
The pericardium is the double walled, fluid filled sac that contains the heart, and is the beginning of major blood vessels, such as the superior and inferior vena cava and aorta. It protects the heart from infection and pressure; it also lubricates and limits its motion. It is often omitted in medical diagrams to better visualize the heart’s structure. The pericardium appears as a thin layer of yellow-white fat, surrounding the outside of the heart.
</p>

<p>
The vena cava, or venae cavae, are two large veins located slightly off-centre towards the right side of the body that return deoxygenated blood from the body into the heart. The inferior vena cava carries the deoxygenated blood from the lower and middle body, whereas the superior vena cava carries deoxygenated blood throughout the upper half of the body, where they both empty into the right atrium of the heart. The superior vena cava is around 7 cm (2.7 inches) long, and the inferior vena cava is 10.16 cm (4 inches) long. They are both 2-3 cm in diameter, though sometimes they will dilate if the person is ill.
</p>

<p>
The aorta is the main, and largest, artery in the human body. Its diameter ranges from 2.5 to 3 cm, while smaller arteries generally have diameters of less than 1 cm. The aorta’s length is 30 cm (1 foot) long. The aorta is responsible for transporting oxygenated blood out of the heart and to the rest of the body. It consists of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta.
